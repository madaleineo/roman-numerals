# roman-numerals
Coding Challenge

My first thought was to make a simple web app that allows the user to input a number in roman numerals, however, I was not able to finish the program,
so much of this is incomplete. 

Please note that if you use npm start or yarn start on the roman-nums folder, the partly finished web app will show up. The button does not work.

Located in roman-nums/romanprac.js, you will find a more complete solution. Just use node romanprac.js to run it. This file contains my comments and will show up in the command line. Please refer to the comments on this file (romanprac.js).

The reason I did this is to show that I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and React as well as JavaScript. I am a bit rusty with JavaScript, but would love the chance to improve. I really loved this challenge and will keep working on it on my own after finishing the interview process. 

Time: I spent the full 4 hours on it and this is how far I got.
Other Notes: Part of my goal at the beginning was to be more efficient with my code. This took me a lot of time and unsuccessful attempts, 
but I know there are ways to do this activity with fewer lines of code.

Thank you so much for considering me.
